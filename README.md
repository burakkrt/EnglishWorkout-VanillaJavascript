# EnglishWorkout-VanillaJavascript

A web application where you can solve beginner-level English questions, store data in the browser's memory without using any database, and continue from where you left off in other time zones.

### What is Vanilla Javascript?
Vanilla JavaScript refers to using plain Javascript without any additional libraries or frameworks.

### What does this project aim for ?
It processes question objects created in Object Oriented Programming (OOP) structure with vanilla Javascript, just like other javascript libraries, in component structure. This avoids code confusion and simplifies future updates.
In addition, with Local Storage, the data is stored in JSON type and allows the user to continue from where they left off when they return to the application in other time zones.
